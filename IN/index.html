His enthusiasm is for something that music, or everything that is beautiful in this world, has awakened him. When a person begins to feel this, his soul immediately harks to await the other thing: even in the presence of what he can grasp, he awaits another thing: he grasps what he can grasp, but he awaits another thing."

  					<div class="sub_title">The Financial Crisis: A Crisis of Desire?</div>
  					<div class="sub_content">In this exhibition we will look at some of the causes of the financial crisis: cheap money from the East (especially China), government policy to keep interest rates low; over borrowing by consumers, especially in the housing market; the housing bubble; over leverage by financial institutions and investors; lack of transparency in the asset backed securities market; some irresponsible trading and speculation; light touch regulation. </br></br>But we will also ask what underlies these causes. </br>Why do we never learn from the boom and bust cycle? Is it just a question of finding the perfect system? Or does the crisis tell us something more interesting about our human nature?</div>

		  		<div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns fixed_height">
  					<div class="sub_title">To be human is to change and to be perfect is to have changed often.</div>
  					<div class="sub_content">How often do we hear a public figure admit that they were wrong? We know from personal experience how difficult it can be. But to do so, even to change radically, is a sign of strength not weakness.</br></br>
This exhibition tells John Henry Newman's dramatic story, from which it emerges that his restless desire for truth was the driving force of his life. This led him to accept both sacrifices and humiliation, and to give up some deeply-rooted prejudices, searching for the real satisfaction that only truth can give: in his words "ex umbris et imaginibus in veritatem" (out of shadows and illusions into truth).</br>We can all learn from Newman's journey, especially because "Newman was a person [continually] converting, a person being transformed, and thus he always remained and became ever more himself"</br></br>(Pope Benedict XVI on his visit to the UK in 2010).</div>
