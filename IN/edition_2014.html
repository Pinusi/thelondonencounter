			  				<div>Today trust in organisations is at a low point.</br>The financial crisis and on-going issues in the banking industry suggest the financial sector is driven by greed. We have seen similar accusations against energy companies.</br> We have had the phone hacking scandal within newspapers and the MPs expenses crisis.</br>Many large multinational have been accused of trying to avoid paying their "fair share" of tax. It seems as if organisations of all types are only interested in themselves and have lost the trust of the public.</br>Picking up the themes developed in the exhibition on the financial crisis "The Financial Crisis: A Crisis of Desire?" our panel will discuss whether or not business can really be conducted for the common good.</div>

But what does it mean to educate and to be educated? Is education only a matter of going to the best schools, achieving excellent results and participating in extra-curricular activities?</div>

	  					<div class="sub_content">In this exhibition we will look at some of the causes of the financial crisis: cheap money from the East (especially China), government policy to keep interest rates low; over borrowing by consumers, especially in the housing market; the housing bubble; over leverage by financial institutions and investors; lack of transparency in the asset backed securities market; some irresponsible trading and speculation; light touch regulation. </br></br>But we will also ask what underlies these causes. </br>Why do we never learn from the boom and bust cycle? Is it just a question of finding the perfect system? Or does the crisis tell us something more interesting about our human nature?</div>
			  		</div>
			  		<div class="large-6 medium-6 small-12 columns fixed_height">
	  					<div class="sub_title">To be human is to change and to be perfect is to have changed often.</div>
	  					<div class="sub_content">How often do we hear a public figure admit that they were wrong? We know from personal experience how difficult it can be. But to do so, even to change radically, is a sign of strength not weakness.</br></br>
	This exhibition tells John Henry Newman's dramatic story, from which it emerges that his restless desire for truth was the driving force of his life. This led him to accept both sacrifices and humiliation, and to give up some deeply-rooted prejudices, searching for the real satisfaction that only truth can give: in his words "ex umbris et imaginibus in veritatem" (out of shadows and illusions into truth).</br>We can all learn from Newman's journey, especially because "Newman was a person [continually] converting, a person being transformed, and thus he always remained and became ever more himself"</br></br>(Pope Benedict XVI on his visit to the UK in 2010).</div>
